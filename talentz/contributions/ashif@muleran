I have got a chance to contribute into Talentz by codeninjaz, This is a Flutter Application with node as a backend to find the talents over internet using different attributes.
but unlike normal application this is done using Beckn Protocol. when we are using beckn protocol, we are actually connected to open interent.
In this Application i was able to contribute in the frontend application and setup the BAP.
The Beckn was new to me and had to completley study and understand it from the mentor.

I was able to help my peer to setup BAP after geting the ideas about it.

I was able to collebrate and study the Beckn from the actual creator of Beckn and mentors.
